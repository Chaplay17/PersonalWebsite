      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Laysha Chaparro. I am from Los Lunas, New Mexico, a small town south of Albuquerque. I am a third year, senior, majoring in psychology and Spanish with a minor in interdisciplinary arts and communications and journalism. As of right now, I am involved in LoboTHON, I am the media chair which mainly focuses on advertising our philanthropy, and ensuring that all our social networking is up-to-date and working for students to access. I am also a program assistant for El Centro de la Raza focusing on managing the El Puente Research Fellowship alongside my supervisor. Last semester I was involved in the undergraduate student government, however, this year I am dedicating my time to focusing on applying and preparing for graduate school.       </p>
      <p> Within the near future I want to apply to the Master of Arts in Counseling at the University of New Mexico to learn the knowledge and skills necessary to provide counseling services that are culturally appropriate to the migrant Latinx communities. I want to be a counselor to help this particular population through the process mental health, the services that are available, and to surpass the negative stereotypes, stigmas, and taboos surrounding it all. A Master of Arts in counseling will allow me to work with vulnerable communities in New Mexico, such as my community of Los Lunas. New Mexico has a variety of cultures, languages, and ethnicities, however, the services offered are not reflective of the state’s citizens and the resources they need. </p>

    <h2>Undergrad</h2>
    <p>As an undergraduate in Psychology and Spanish, I created a research project on counseling services and resources through the El Puente Research Fellowship.  My bibliographic research explored mental health services offered to Mexican Migrant women living in the United States suffering from Postpartum Depression. I found that Mexican Americans had cultural ideas that taught them to avoid speaking about their emotions or seeking help.  The services that are available to Mexican Americans are not culturally relevant, nor do they expand on how Latinx communities cope with emotional distress and traumatic events.</p>
    <p>As an intern for the National Latino Behavioral Health Association, I witnessed accessibility issues with Latinx populations who were coming from rural communities. People who often live in rural communities across New Mexico are racially, ethnically, and culturally diverse. Migrant parents and guardians came to us often, desperately begging for services, specifically for their Latino kids, to understand what mental health was and how to support their loved ones through it. The anguished looks on their faces shocked me, as I knew this was a prevalent issue amongst adolescents and families, but had never seen it face to face, especially from a community I belonged to. The impact I saw within U.S. Latinx community opened my eyes regarding smaller groups, such as those of migrant communities in New Mexico that I have had direct contact with. The lack of resources that these small New Mexican migrant communities face is not enough for the emotional distress they endure. The opportunity to make an impact through counseling services shapes my commitment to becoming a counselor. </p>

      <h2>Job Opportunities</h2>
      <p>Currently, I work as a program Assistant at El Centro de la Raza, a Latina/o/x resource center at the University of New Mexico (UNM), I have learned the importance of multicultural competence and have gained experience with cultural pluralism. Networking and collaborating with different student resources here has given me the opportunity to learn from diverse cultural, ethnic, religious, and social groups at UNM. The knowledge I have gained from collaborating with the African American Student Services and the American Indian Student Services has allowed me to learn about the diverse histories of oppression that shape the experiences of Mexican Americans, African Americans, and Native American communities in New Mexico. I have come to realize that ethnically diverse communities share common taboos surrounding mental health, which has been a priority when creating programming for undergraduate students. All these different opportunities have broadened my interest in mental health, especially culturally appropriate services offered to diverse communities.
</p>
      <p>I also have the experience of being a substitute teacher at my hometown district of Los Lunas, where I have had the ability to expand on my knowledge as well as gain experience with the youth and their growth as not just scholars but also human beings. Being a substitute teacher, especially at the young age of twenty has not always been easy. Not only was my age a consistent factor being reflected to me with the lack of respect I received but it was also a new perspective that not many appreciated. This allowed me to grow as a professional in developing thicker skin when it came down to judgment for being different in gender, age, and beliefs. However, it all taught me be patient and attempt to understand the opposing side, even if I don’t particularly believe in it. </p>

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>Graduating with my master’s degree is one step toward my career goals. I want to continue my degree plan at UNM pursuing a Ph.D. in counseling, however, that will be after I have dedicated time as a practicing counselor. My ultimate goal is to help my community by providing culturally relevant mental health services and to educate future counselors. I don’t want to continue the cycle I went through, where my Latinx family didn’t fully understand my anxiety and depression. The culture I grew up with was Mexican culture, and what I have learned and love about it is how it focuses on communidad and convivencia, meaning gathering as a community and creating a bond. My objective is to provide services that make people feel welcomed, to create bonds through each session where comfort and trust continue to grow. My mom always reminded me, “whatever you do, make sure you have love and passion for it” and that is what I feel towards counseling; a passion that keeps me going even when I hear that it is a heart-wrenching career path with constant difficult scenarios. The passion I have for helping my community and empowering their emotions, thoughts and action as they trust me with their mental health issues is something I look forward to. I have seen the impact that community and culturally appropriate services can create, and I would like to partake in that impactful change. There are too many Latinx communities suffering in silence, I want to ensure they don’t go unheard any longer.</p>

      <h2>My Motivation</h2>
      <p>A lot of people have asked me why I am so passionate about counseling services and culturally appropriate services, and it’s because that’s what I needed when I was 16. I was suffering with my mental health, having to take medication for anxiety and depression, and being ashamed through it all. I lacked support from my family as a whole, because of the taboo that comes from Latinos towards mental health issues and considering it to be a demonstration of weakness. With all these negative stigmas always coming up, I was ashamed to tell my family what I was going through. Thankfully, my mom was there to support me and taught me the importance of my mental health, just as it would be important to ensure that I was physically healthy as well. In my experiences in and out of different therapy and counseling, I had a lot of difficulty finding a counselor that appropriately represented me and understood the issues that I had. Because the psychology field typically is filled with Anglo service providers, they didn’t understand the cultural components that I needed to heal. With time and a lot of effort, I was finally able to advocate for myself and find counseling services that were culturally appropriate and significant to me. That’s where I was inspired to work on myself, and potentially end up being a service provider through counseling and therapy to help those who need the help that I did. My experience has kept me going, to ensure others don’t face the same negative cycle with their own mental health.</p>
